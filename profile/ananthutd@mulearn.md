Well, leadership, huh? If you've seen me try to organize a pizza party, you'd know I'm still working on herding those toppings into order!
But, on a more serious note, I'm not Captain America, but I do have some leadership skills.
I've managed to keep my code projects afloat, sort of like a coding ship captain. So, I might not lead the Avengers, but I can lead a coding project.
